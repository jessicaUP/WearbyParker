## USER AUTHENTICATION

First time users can easily create an account or use the provided Demo User profile. All features of the site are availble without login, however to save your cart one must be logged in. When a user has a cart prior to loging in, the current cart will be prioritized over the cart stored on the user account.

## SHOPPING CART / TRYON CART

This duel cart feature allows users to add items ready for purchase alongside up to 5 items to tryon for free. To add items to the cart, users are navigated through a multi-page form for an intuitive experience. 

* TRYON
> By pressing the toggle on the product index, each product populates a button to allow users to add to cart.
> The switch is automatically turned off unless user navigates though the 'Home Try-on' located in the main navigation bar. A query is added, prompting the tryon toggle to turn on.
